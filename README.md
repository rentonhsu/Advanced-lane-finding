**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the eighth code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./example.ipynb".  
I used 17 images taken by the same camera to computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. The more images we have, the more accurate camera calibration would be.
I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

Sobel operations, directional gradients, color channels are common ways the create thresholded binary images. I've tried different ways to find the best solution, and found by applying a bitwise "OR" operation on thresholded binary images generated by Sobel-x and s channel got me the best result. Also, i applied a mask to preserve only the pixels close to the lane.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

To compute the perspective transform, i'm using cv2.getPerspectiveTransform() function, and cv2.warpPerspective() to generate a warped image given the perspective transform. In this case we're mapping the perspective view to a flat plane, so we need four source points and four targe points. Here's the example of a transformed image:

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

To identify lane-line pixels , i had a function called "lane_finding()". This function create a histogram, with this histogram I addedg up the pixel values along each column in the image. In my thresholded binary image, pixels are either 0 or 255, so the two most prominent peaks in this histogram will be good indicators of the x-position of the base of the lane lines. I can use that as a starting point for where to search for the lines. From that point, I can use a sliding window, placed around the line centers, to find and follow the lines up to the top of the frame.
"polynomial_of_lane()" is the function to fit the lane-line pixels positions with a polynomial given the x and y values. Lane lines weren't always straight, so in this case it fitted them to a quadratic polynomial.

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

To calculate the radius of curvature and the position of the vehicle with respect to center, i defined a function "curvature()" and implemented what i learned in the "Measuring Curvature" section.

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_output.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Even the video output showed a good accuracy on lane line finding, but there were still few frames that didn't perform well, the image down below shows one of the examples. The line on the right was skewed because there were just a little lane-line pixels that were found, so it leaded to overfitting . This can be solved by covering a wider area when doing lane searching. Other than that i think i'm pretty satisfied with the result.
